/*
 * Add the standard samtools @PG line to header h, recording the program
 * (PN:samtools), the version (VN) and, when arg_list is not NULL, the command
 * line (CL).  htslib assigns a collision-free ID and links PP: to the previous
 * @PG record.
 *
 * VN holds the samtools version.  As SAMtools and HTSlib are released together
 * with matching major and minor version numbers, the HTSlib version can usually
 * be deduced from it; when it cannot (the major or minor numbers differ) it is
 * appended, e.g. "1.23.1 (with HTSlib 1.24)".
 *
 * When no_pg is non-zero this is a no-op (the --no-PG opt-out), so callers can
 * unconditionally call it and pass their opt-out flag through.  arg_list may be
 * NULL if no command line is available.
 *
 * Returns 0 on success,
 *        -1 on failure.
